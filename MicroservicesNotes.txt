Monolithic architecture:
==========================

multiple components are combined in single large app.

For example: product module,users module,order module,payment module, shipment module,cart module
all the above module in single packet.

Disadvantge of monolithic architecture
=======================================
1.single code base
2.deployed in single bundle
3.change in one service then whole app is redeployed
4. Building problem: developers has to communicate
5. Problem in scale
6. Cumbersome(Hard to maintain) over time

Microservices
===============>
1. Large apps are divide into small parts.
2. Different codebase
3. Each Module Managed independently.
4. Different tech stack [java,python]

Disadvantages
===============>
1. Handling microservices is complex.
 
Note: all small parts can communicate using REST APIS.

Hotel Service use db1 -> microservice1- use any tech stack.
User Service use db2 ->  microservice 2- use any tech stack.
Rating Service use db3-> microservice 3- use any tech stack.


                   Registered
service registry(Track all the information of indivial services)----------------->connected with userservice,rating service and hotel service.

Lets start building microservices
